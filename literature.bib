abstract={This paper addresses the problem of reliably detecting parking spots in semi-filled parking lots using on-board laser line scanners. In order to identify parking spots, one needs to detect parked vehicles and interpret the parking environment. Our approach uses a supervised learning technique to achieve vehicle detection by identifying vehicle bumpers from laser range scans. In particular, we use AdaBoost to train a classifier based on relevant geometric features of data segments that correspond to car bumpers. Using the detected bumpers as landmarks of vehicle hypotheses, our algorithm constructs a topological graph representing the structure of the parking space. Spatial analysis is then performed on the topological graph to identify potential parking spots. Algorithm performance is evaluated through a series of experimental tests.},

abstract="Parking is a huge problem in densely populated areas and drivers spend a significant amount of time finding a suitable place to park their cars. A system that could show drivers the nearest available space would result in enormous savings of time, fuel, and street space. In order to achieve that, real-world periodic statistical analysis of car parking areas could help increase efficiency. Ideally, real-time information could also be used to create personalized suggestions to drivers, thus enabling satisficing of a wide range of possible criteria of optimality. We propose a system that uses a single camera for a wide-area external parking, followed by a combination of two kinds of algorithms: static image analysis of parking lot spaces using a combination of histogram classification and edge detection, and dynamic image analysis using blob analysis. Our system thus achieves monitoring of parking spaces and reports statistics as well as empty slots in real-time. Our results indicate that almost 90{\%} of empty spots are reported correctly, resulting in significant savings through a highly cost-effective single-camera system which can monitor more than 100 spaces.",

abstract="Vehicles searching for a vacant parking spot on the street can amount to as much as 40 {\%} of the traffic in certain city areas, thus largely affecting mobility in urban environments. For this reason, it would be desirable to create integrated smart traffic management systems capable of providing real-time information to drivers about the location of available vacant parking spots. A scalable solution would consist in exploiting the existing and widely-deployed video surveillance camera networks, which requires the development of computer vision algorithms for detecting vacant parking spots. Following this idea, this work introduces QuickSpot, a car-driven video analytics solution for on-street vacant parking spot detection designed as a motion detection, object tracking and visual recognition pipeline. One of the main features of QuickSpot is its simplified setup, as it can be trained on external databases to learn the appearances of the objects it is capable of recognizing (pedestrians and vehicles). To test its performance under different daytime lighting conditions, we have recorded, edited, annotated and made available to the research community the QuickSpotDB video database for the vacant parking spot detection problem. In the conducted experiments, we have evaluated the trade-off between the accuracy and the computational complexity of QuickSpot with an eye to its practical applicability. The results show that QuickSpot detects parking spot status with an average accuracy close to 99 {\%} at a 1-second rate regardless of the illumination conditions, outperforming in an indirect comparison the other car-driven approaches reported in the literature.",

abstract="This paper proposes a free parking space detection system by using motion stereo-based 3D reconstruction. An image sequence is acquired with a single rearview fisheye camera and the view behind the automobile is three-dimensionally reconstructed by using point correspondences. Metric information is recovered from the camera height ratio and free parking spaces are detected by estimating the positions of adjacent vehicles. Since adjacent vehicles are usually located near the epipole, their structures are seriously degraded. To solve this problem, we select point correspondences by using a de-rotation-based method and mosaic 3D structures by estimating a similarity transformation. Unlike in previous work, our system proposes an efficient way of locating free parking spaces in 3D point clouds. Odometry is not used because its accuracy depends largely on road conditions. In the experiments, the system was tested in 154 different parking situations and its success rate was 90{\%} (139 successes in 154 cases). The detection accuracy was evaluated by using ground truth data that was acquired with a laser scanner.",
