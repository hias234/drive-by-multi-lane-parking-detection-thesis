\chapter{Prototype Implementation}
\label{chap:referenceimplementation}

This chapter will discuss how the prototype was designed, implemented and evaluated. Section \ref{sec:system_design} will discuss the overall envisioned system, the prototype car and the required sensors with their capabilities. In section \ref{sec:experiment_description_data_collection} the experimental setup will be discussed as well as the acquiring of the test dataset through test drives in the city of Linz, Austria. Finally, section \ref{sec:data_processing} will describe the preprocessing of the data, definition of the features and a short description of all used machine learning algorithms with their configurations. \todo{update :)}

\section{System design}
\label{sec:system_design}

This section will describe the envisioned system for the urban parking availability detection system. The proposed system is a mobile sensing system where sensing vehicles try to detect parking cars while driving through the city. 

- System description (type of sensors, requirements); overall envisioned system of cars detecting free spaces and communicating the information

\subsection{Test bed description}
\label{sec:test_bed}

- Testbed description (concrete HW and technical capabilities)

Figure \ref{fig:sensing_car} shows the sensing car and its mounted sensors.
