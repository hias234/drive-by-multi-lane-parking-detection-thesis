\label{chap:conclusion}



This thesis focuses on sensing a city's parking space availability situation to increase the transparency of the current parking situation. 
A known parking space availability situation can help drivers which are searching for vacant parking spaces to directly navigate to a vacant spot and avoid driving around blocks. This can reduce traffic congestion, green house gas emissions, and driver frustration. 
In this work, an experiment with drive-by parking space detection has been conducted with the goal to create accurate parking space availability maps. The contribution of this thesis should help to show at what accuracy drive-by detection systems can operate. Especially the performance of such a system in real world traffic scenarios on streets with multiple lanes and a lot of traffic is of interest.
The following paragraphs summarize the most essential aspects of this work, its results, and its most important conclusions.
