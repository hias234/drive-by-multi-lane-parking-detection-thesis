\section{Machine Learning Results}

This section discusses the results of the machine learning experiments with common machine learning models using computed feature values as input. As evaluation-method 10-fold cross validation has been chosen. Figure ... shows the comparison of several machine learning models with different parameters in terms of accuracy, precision and recall of the "parking car"-class and the necessary runtime to learn the model.




Comparison of all tested algorithms -> accuracy -> different feature sets -> Graphics

Description of Graphic

Maybe binary classification

Filtered Dataset -> Parking Space Maps

Stacked Classifier


\section{Deep Learning Results}

Same as Machine Learning REsults





\section{Comparison to ParkNet}

Using only the two features used in ParkNet - Which accuracy can be reached on our dataset.

ca 75\% recall and precision using ParkNet-approach
