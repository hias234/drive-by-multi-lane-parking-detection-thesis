\section{Machine Learning Results}

Comparison of all tested algorithms -> accuracy -> different feature sets -> Graphics

Description of Graphic

Maybe binary classification




\section{Deep Learning Results}

Same as Machine Learning REsults





\section{Comparison to ParkNet}

Using only the two features used in ParkNet - Which accuracy can be reached on our dataset.

ca 75\% recall and precision using ParkNet-approach
