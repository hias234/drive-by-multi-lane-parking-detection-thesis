\section{Machine Learning Results}

This section discusses the results of the machine learning experiments with common machine learning models using computed feature values as input. As evaluation-method 10-fold cross validation has been chosen. Figure ... shows the comparison of several machine learning models with different parameters in terms of accuracy, precision and recall of the "parking car"-class and the necessary runtime to learn the model.

\section{Comparison to existing Parking Detection Systems}

The existing prototype of a parking detection system which is closest related to the prototype presented in this thesis is the ParkNet prototype developed by Mathur et al \cite{Mathur:2010:PDS:1814433.1814448}. ParkNet uses a similar system to detect parking cars. It measures the distance to the right side to the road using an ultrasonic distance sensor and tries to find dips in the sensor signal, which represent parking cars. However, ParkNet was only developed and designed for a very restrictive area of road side streets. They gathered test data only on single-lane streets with parallel parking cars and also only tested their prototype in such areas. 

The main goal of this thesis is to develop a drive-by parking detection system, which can handle various different situations in city traffic, like for example driving on multi-lane streets, overtaking other vehicles, traffic jams and waiting at traffic lights. While gathering the dataset, all of these situations were faced and our prototype is trained to detect them.
