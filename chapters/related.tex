\chapter{Related Work}
\label{chap:relatedwork}

This chapter will cover work related to park sensing and machine learning. Section \ref{sec:parksensing} will discuss different approaches to sensing current parking situations in cities. Furthermore, a comparison of them will be given as well as advantages and disadvantages of the specific approaches. \todo{Machine Learning...}



\section{Approaches to Park Sensing}
\label{sec:parksensing}

There already exist numerous approaches to detecting the states of parking spaces as well as the parking situation in a city. In this section parking detection approaches will be categorized in five different categories and in the following subsections several reference papers for all categories will be discussed. The first section about stationary park sensing (section \ref{sec:stationary_park_sensing}) will reference approaches where sensors are stationary deployed per parking space or parking area. Section \ref{sec:counting_in_out_park_sensing} will discuss counting in- and outgoing vehicles to coarsely detect parking space counts. Another approach is to detect certain events (for instance parking and unparking) to estimate parking space counts. Section \ref{sec:event_detection_park_sensing} will discuss several related papers in this area. Drive-by sensing will be discussed in sections \ref{sec:related_driveby_park_sensing_cameras} and \ref{sec:related_driveby_park_sensing_distance}. Using cameras to detect parking spaces while driving by will be referenced in section \ref{sec:related_driveby_park_sensing_cameras}, while section \ref{sec:related_driveby_park_sensing_distance} will cover using distance sensors.
