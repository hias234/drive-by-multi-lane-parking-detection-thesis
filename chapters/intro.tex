Currently the road side parking situation in most cities is rather untransparent. Except from parking garages and the like information about the availability of parking spaces is rarely available. However, finding parking spaces in urban areas can be a really difficult, frustrating and time consuming task for drivers. Furthermore, information about free parking spaces can help to reduce traffic by a tremendous amount. Studies have shown that in urban areas about 30\% of traffic congestion is created by drivers looking for free parking spaces \cite{Nawaz:2013:PSB:2500423.2500438} and that in 2007 a loss of about \$78 billion U.S. dollars was created by the use of about 2.9 billion gallons of gasoline alone in the USA \cite{TexasMobilityReport}. Furthermore, about 4.9 billion hours were wasted by drivers while looking for parking spaces during that year.
